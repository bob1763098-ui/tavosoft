I am happy
You are tall
He is kind
She runs fast
We eat now
They sleep well
It is big
I was sad
You walked home
He played soccer
She danced yesterday
We will sing
They were here
It rains today
I love books
You read slowly
He writes letters
She paints walls
We watch movies
They swim daily
It was cold
I will go
You saw stars
He found keys
She bought flowers
We are tired
They run quickly
It seems easy
I have fun
You drink water
He cooks dinner
She cleans rooms
We play games
They study hard
It feels good
I worked late
You laughed loud
He jumped high
She fell down
We waited long
They talked much
It looked nice
I can swim
You should rest
He might come
She could dance
We want food
They need help
It sounds great
I ate breakfast
You drank coffee
He wrote notes
She read stories
We watched TV
They sang songs
It was fun
I will try
You are late
He seems busy
She looks pretty
We feel cold
They walk far
It is sunny
I had lunch
You saw birds
He caught fish
She drew pictures
We made cookies
They built houses
It smells good
